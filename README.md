# About this repository

I will mainly upload here all the projects and exercises image related. Depending on the algorithm and the oackages that I will use, I may not upload the whole content as Github has a 25Mb limit for the uploads. However, feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanpgdata) if you have any question about my projects.
